	<img src="images/backup.png" alt="Backup" title="Unparalelled peace of mind.">

	<p>If the power in your office or data center fails tonight, and all of your computers crash, how quickly can you recover? More importantly, how will it impact your business? According to the U.S. Department of Labor, 93% of companies that experience a disaster go out of business within 5 years – even if they can recover in the short term.</p>

	<p>We’re here to ensure your business doesn’t become another statistic.
